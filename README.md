# Daily coding puzzle

It's simple: each day, a new coding puzzle to solve. It's not necessarily heavily complicated, the idea is just to 
train and have fun. I also try to have puzzles on various domains if possible.

Most of the time, I find the puzzles on website like [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) or books like [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.fr/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1532022516&sr=8-1&keywords=cracking+the+code+interview)
